    "- The resistor with value $10k\\Omega$ and the resistor with value $30 k\\Omega$ are in series and that's why their values were added\n",
    "- *Most important* in the calculation, the resistors have values in kilo $\\Omega$ which means that there is afactor of 1000 or $10^3$ in the denominator. After the calculation it will appear as $10^{-3}$ which is referred to as mili. That's why we have written the answer in $mA$ and not in $A$. There is quite a big difference between $4.5 A$ and $4.5 mA$. For instance $4.5A$ is most likely to be taken by the whole fridge in your house while $4.5 mA$ might be the kind of current of one componenet in your mobile phone. In other words you most certainly die if your body suffers a $4A$ surge of current (from lighting) but will most probably survive a $4.5 mA$ current"

    "Well, we have seen this. It has been described as a *dependent* voltage source. So the value of the voltage developed is given by 30 thousand times the value of the current $i$. As we know that the value of the current $i = 4.5 mA$ then the dependent voltage source is delivering $30000 (4.5\\times10^{-3}) = 30\\times10^3 (4.5\\times10^{-3}) = 30(4.5) = 135 V$\n",

    "Yes, it looks crazy in this case, something we cannot easyly explain or are used to. So, this is telling you that from $4.5 mA$ $135 V$ are generated. But there is no mystery in it, if you make $4.5 mA$ to pass through a resistor of $30 k\\Omega$ then $135 V$ would appear across the resistor. The cost of a resistor of a $30 k\\Omega$ resistor is the same as the cost of a $180 \\Omega$ resistor but the power it need to be able to dissipate in these conditions would be quite different.  \n",

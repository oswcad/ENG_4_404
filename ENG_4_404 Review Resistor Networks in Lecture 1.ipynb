    "In slide 22 of Lecture 1 there is an exercise with the circuit ![A resistor circuit](ResistorCircuit.png \"circuit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "the task is to combine series and parallel resistors accordingly to simplify circuits and determine equivalent resistances. Let's try that. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: ** The idea is to replace all the 5 resistors into a single resistor value. This one resistor will replace the previous 5 resistors across the terminals *a* and *b* so that has a value equivalent to all the old previous 5 resistors combined. The combination follows rules about how resistors are combined when either in *series* or *parallel* configurations. "

Just make sure not to combine $k\\Omega$ with $\\Omega$ in the same calculation (for any other mismatch).  \n"
